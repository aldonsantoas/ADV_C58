        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is vey good habit which can make me a completer. this hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books kepp one always happy and busy. It is good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual, and most importantly a successful person in life.</p>
